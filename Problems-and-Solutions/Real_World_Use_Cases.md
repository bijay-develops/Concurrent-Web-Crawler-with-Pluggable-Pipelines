# 3. Real-World Use Cases

## 1. Search Engines 🧠

### Problem

* Crawl **billions of pages**
* Handle slow networks
* Avoid duplicate indexing

### How concurrent crawlers help

* Massive parallelism
* URL deduplication
* Domain-level rate limiting

### Example

```text
Googlebot, Bingbot
```

➡ Without concurrency → impossible scale

---

## 2. Website Monitoring & Health Checks 📡

### Use case

* Monitor hundreds or thousands of URLs
* Detect downtime, slow pages, broken links

### Why concurrency matters

* Checks must run **frequently**
* Fast response required

### Example

```text
Ping homepage
Check /login
Check /api/status
```

➡ Concurrent crawler = faster alerts

---

## 3. Web Scraping 🕷️

### Use case

* Price comparison
* Job listings
* News aggregation

### Benefits

* High throughput scraping
* Respect rate limits using worker pools
* Safe data collection

### Example

```text
Amazon → product pages
Indeed → job listings
News sites → articles
```

---

## 4. Link Validation Tools 🔗

### Problem

* Large websites contain thousands of links
* Broken links hurt SEO

### Solution

* Concurrent crawling
* Fast detection

### Example tools

```text
CI/CD link checkers
Static site generators
```

---

## 5. Security & Compliance Scanning 🔐

### Use case

* Crawl sites for exposed endpoints
* Detect misconfigurations

### Why concurrency

* Large attack surface
* Time-sensitive scans

---

## 6. Internal Microservice Discovery ⚙️

### Use case

* Crawl internal service URLs
* Detect unhealthy services

➡ Very common in **cloud & DevOps**

# Summary

### Single-Threaded Crawler

> Simple but slow, inefficient, and not scalable.

### Go Concurrent Crawler

> Uses goroutines, channels, and mutexes to crawl pages **safely, efficiently, and at scale**.

### One-Line Comparison

> A concurrent crawler overlaps network waits and controls shared state, while a single-threaded crawler wastes time waiting and cannot scale.
